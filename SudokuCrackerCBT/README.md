# How to run

In Program.cs you can set two constants:
- Benchmark
  - True: shows benchmarks.\
    **NOTE: project must be run in release mode, and there may not be weird characters in the path to the project (like spaces or underscores).**
  - False: shows the solutions to the sudokus.
- SudokusPath
  - Relative path to a file containing the sudokus to solve, following the format specified in the example sudokus.
  - You can add as many sudokus as you like, the code will handle them.

# How to read the benchmarks
*The benchmarks are generated by the [BenchmarkDotNet package](https://benchmarkdotnet.org/index.html).*

When running in benchmark mode, the program will print the results to the console.
At first you will see that BenchmarkDotNet is warming up, and after that it will run the benchmarks.
When completed, the following table is what you want to look at:
```
[TOOD: Insert table of latest benchmark]
```
**Method**: the method used to solve the sudoku.\
**Sudoku**: the sudoku to solve.\
**Mean**: the mean time it took to solve the sudoku.\
**Allocated**: the amount of memory allocated to solve the sudoku.

These are some results I got on my laptop. As you can see, 5 benchmarks were run, one for each sudoku to solve.
